		<p>Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th century, a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute player in the Book of Ingenious Devices.[4][5] In 1206, the Arab engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where a musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms and drum patterns, via pegs and cams.[6][7] In 1801, the Jacquard loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the "program" – a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.

		Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. In the 9th century, the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi described a cryptographic algorithm for deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first description of cryptanalysis by frequency analysis, the earliest code-breaking algorithm.[8]

		The first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.[9]

		Data and instructions were once stored on external punched cards, which were kept in order and arranged in program decks.
		In the 1880s Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in machine-readable form.[10] Later a control panel (plug board) added to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a similar way, as were the first electronic computers. However, with the concept of the stored-program computer introduced in 1949, both programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in computer memory.[11]

		<h2 id = "data">Data Machine part</h2>

		<p>Machine code was the language of early programs, written in the instruction set of the particular machine, often in binary notation. Assembly languages were soon developed that let the programmer specify instruction in a text format, (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL), with abbreviations for each operation code and meaningful names for specifying addresses. However, because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine language, any two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages.

		<h2 id = "compiler">Compiler part</h2>
		<p>High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less bound to the underlying hardware. FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957[12] and many other languages were soon developed—in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.

		These compiled languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer, and more capable of abstracting the code, making it easy to target for varying machine instruction sets via compilation declarations and heuristics. The first compiler for a programming language was developed by Grace Hopper.[13] When Hopper went to work on UNIVAC in 1949, she brought the idea of using compilers with her.[14][15] Compilers harness the power of computers to make programming easier[12] by allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula using infix notation (e.g., Y = X*2 + 5*X + 9) for example. FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation which permitted the abstraction of reusable blocks of code, came out in 1957[12] and many other languages were soon developed—in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research. In 1951 Frances E. Holberton developed the first sort-merge generator, which ran on the UNIVAC I.[16] Another woman working at UNIVAC, Adele Mildred Koss, developed a program that was a precursor to report generators.[16] The idea for the creation of COBOL started in 1959 when Mary K. Hawes, who worked for the Burroughs Corporation, set up a meeting to discuss creating a common business language.[17] She invited six people, including Grace Hopper.[17] Hopper was involved in developing COBOL as a business language and creating "self-documenting" programming.[18][19] Hopper's contribution to COBOL was based on her programming language, called FLOW-MATIC.[15] In 1961, Jean E. Sammet developed FORMAC and also published Programming Languages: History and Fundamentals, which went on to be a standard work on programming languages.[17][20]
